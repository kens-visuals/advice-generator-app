## My process

### Built with

- React
- Styled Components
- [stoic-quotes API](https://github.com/benhoneywill/stoic-quotes)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This wasn't the first time of me working with API, but a similar project was on my list for a while. Now, thanks to Frontend Mentor's good looking design, I've got a random Stoic advice generator that I'm using on daily basis. Although the initial API was different, I wanted to build something that me and my friends will use on daily basis. And when I add the website to my phone's homescreen it feels like a legit app. I'm pretty pumped on this, and as would Epictetus say, "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.".

### Continued development

I'm planning on adding animation to this project, I'm currently learning Framer Motion. Perhaps, my up and coming projects will already include animations.

### Useful resources
